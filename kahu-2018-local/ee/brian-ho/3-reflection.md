# What did I do well this week?

I kept on reminding myself about 'process over product' while doing website redesign. I like the theme of my original design, so I tried to stick to the same theme while redesigning the website. I kind of like the final look of my web pages. I didn't plan the final look at once. I just focus on the process and I get the result.

Other than doing testing with browser, I also use my phone to test the new layout. From that I found an issue that the layout was not really responsive in my phone. It was because I didn't set the 'viewport' in the html to tell browser to scale to the size of mobile screen. I'm glad that I used real device to do the testing.


# What could I have done to improve?

I have trouble managing my time when the distractions from real life kicked in. I was also feel feeling fatigue and sleepy at the wrong time. I really need to manage the balance of work and rest time.

Regarding reading on second chapter of 'Search Inside Yourself', I was waiting the perfect moment to trigger audio reading. Well, the perfect moment was really hard to come by. At the end, the delay was too much, causing no progress and slipping my sprint schedule. I should have started visual reading earlier instead of insisting on waiting for perfect moment for audio reading.
