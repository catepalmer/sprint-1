# What did I do well this week?

I managed to finish coding assignment parts in the earlier of the week. I like that I can help people from my cohort move forward at their assignments.

# What could I have done to improve?

Oral Communication is still my weakness. Unlike writing, there is no luxury of time to slowly think through how and what I should express certain thought. Look like the only solution is to keep on practicing.

I was not really doing at a good speed when working on the later part of the Sprint assignment that involve a lot of reading and writing. I guess "keep on practicing" is the only answer.
