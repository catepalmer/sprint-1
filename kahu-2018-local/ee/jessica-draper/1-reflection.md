Why is reflection important?
It can help build confidence, development and give you some direction for achieving a goal.
What did i do well this week?
I managed to get through a decent amount of content and i was proud of myself for making my study as much of a main priority as i could.
What could i have done to improve?
I think i could have improved on my planning of what i was going to do this last week.  Setting myself goals and challenges for each day would have been a good way of some type of acountability.  I am going to try and do this for the next few weeks to see if it will help.
