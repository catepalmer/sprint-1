Allows me to better understand how I am tracking and why I did what I did

 What did I do well this week?
 Overall I think this this week was a settling in week, I feel comfortable with the html and css pages, and I am enjoying learning the 
 soft skills.  
 
 What could I have done to improve?
 The main issues for me this week have been clonong kahu-2018 problematic every time, and "going down the rabbit hole" I have to ensure I
