What did I do well this week?
Well, I spent less time 'down the rabbit hole' and more time focused on
getting through the course ware. I also started mindfulness 2 minutes at a time.

What could I have done to improve?
I was a little bit hesitant when using git and creating branches, and my time keeping could have been better.
