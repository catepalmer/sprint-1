Reflection

What have I done well
Using Nano to edit my reflection file this week
Tackled some of the algorithm challenges and came up with solutions
Meet up with some recent Dev Acadmy grads

What do I need to improve on
My blog entries do feel flat. I can focus on making them feel more
I haven't been disciplined on the typing and meditation practice
Need to get head round iterators
I haven't posted an accountability update for a few weeks so need to start doiing that
Some parts of that Eloquent Javascript chapter did not amke sense (e.g. recurrsion)
