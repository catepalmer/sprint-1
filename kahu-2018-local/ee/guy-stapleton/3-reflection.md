What did I do well this week?

- [Working on improving my typing speed. Spending time practicing not looking at they keyboard while typing and have a clear goal of where I wwant to be by start of dev academy.] -->
- [Learnt how to implement Font Awesome for the social media icons for my redesigned website]
- [Using that python SimpleHTTPServer trick all the time now rather than browsing to the file location]
- [Wrote my first code snippet in Atom!]


What could I have done to improve?

- [A lot of my layout problems are caused by missing div tags. I might need to improve my tidiness. Also, I tend to write the css for layout by instinct but often end u with results that I don't expect. I need to brush up on that. I also would benefit from maybe working things out on paper more rather than just type away. I also haven't been validating my code so need]
- [I need to spend some time looking at design and breaking them down]
- [I was pretty lazy when implementing Font Awesome and didn't really read the documentation properly. I tried to find an example of how to use it and went with that instead. Not a great habit to get into]
