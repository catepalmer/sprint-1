What's gone well this week
- I got through the Javascipt exercises ok
- I am practicing typing without looking at the keyboard and identifying what keys and common errors I am making.
- I started learning Sketch to create some images for my blog

 
What do I need to do differently
- I need to make changes to how I apply the mindfulness practices. I'ld benefit from practicing these in day to day.
- I'ld benefit from noting things done in one spot. I have a few notepads on the go at once, so things can get spread out.
- Record which exercises I struggled with.
- I haven't really made changes based
