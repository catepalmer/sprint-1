How did I do this week?
- Making time to do course prep work in the evenings
- Made some flash cards to learn command line and atom shortcuts
- Finished reading Search Inside Yourself

What could I have done to improve?
- Did not spend much time trying to improve typing speed
- Didn't read instructions to assignment 2.5 correctly so had to spend time repeating work
- Question myself more when things are not working rather than try making changes. e.g. If this was working, what would I expect to see?
