What did I do well this week?

My time management was really good this week. I allocated a specific time to work on sprint 2, and spent the whole time focused on it.

What could I have done to improve?

Coming back to it after a few days of not touching it, I'm already a bit rusty! I think I should try to spread it out a little bit so that it stays fresh on my mind.
