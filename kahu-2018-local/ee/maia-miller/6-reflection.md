What did I do well this week?

I asked for help from a friend when I needed it, which was helpful because then I could actually have a conversation to ask questions and get clarifications. I feel like I understood the solutions I came to this week. The technical blog also helped me gain a bigger picture understanding of JS syntax, which was super cool.

What could I have done to improve?

I am a bit concerned about time so I am skipping the stretch goals to come back to later hopefully. More time for each sprint would be nice!
