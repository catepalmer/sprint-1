What did I do well this week?

JavaScript is completely new to me, so I think I did a good job of trying my best! I took notes during all the lessons and tried hard to internalize the information.

 What could I have done to improve?

 I'm still not super solid on some of the concepts of JavaScript. I think real-world application of the language will help me understand some of the concepts and uses of it.
