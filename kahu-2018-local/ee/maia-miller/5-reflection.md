What did I do well this week?

I asked for help this week when I needed it, before I got too fed up to deal with the result. Likewise, I am continuing that Slack thread to ensure that I understand the logic behind the help.

 What could I have done to improve?

 I took what felt like a REALLY long time to complete this sprint. It would be helpful for absorbing information if I did sprints in fewer chunks so that I can sit, focus and remember what was covered.
