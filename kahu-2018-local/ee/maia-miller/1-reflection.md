Why is reflection important?

From reflection, you learn. We're likely to repeat behaviours over and over without any improvement if we don't take time to look back and reflect upon what was successful and where we can improve for the future.

What did I do well this week?

I learned a lot! I figured out what GitHub is and how to use it (more or less), how to use command line, and refreshed on my HTML and CSS.

What could I have done to improve?

Time management! Because I have a lot of time on my hands right now to work on the sprints, I spent a good chunk of it dilly-dallying or avoiding working. Next week, I'm going to allocate only a certain amount of time to complete tasks so that I make better use of it.
