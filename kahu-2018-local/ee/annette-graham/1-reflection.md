1. Why is reflection important?
- Reflection is important as it allows you to look back on what you have done and identify not only on what worked well, but also on where you can improve in future.

2. What did I do well this week?
- I think I did well to complete the first sprint more quickly than I had predicted. There was a lot of foreign concepts that I learned on the go, which I'm somewhat proud of. I also managed to overcome my first roadblock.

3. What could I have done to improve?
- I stressed out a bit too much when I hit an issue that I couldn't (easily) find a solution for. I need to realize that I will encounter many more of these and need to keep a more level head!
