Why is reflection important?

Reflection is so important! It's like you're standing in a waterfall of learning, and reflection is a moment to step outside and observe the waterfall, how it falls, how it falls on you and how you absorb it. Taking a moment to step outside allows you to think about how you're doing, why you're doing it, and what you could be doing better.

 What did I do well this week?
Getting confident with github and the command line has been great. I can't believe I've almost finished the first week's work with everything else I've got going on - pretty proud of that.

 What could I have done to improve?
 I'm under a huge amount of time pressure because I'm actually on holiday with my parents in London, while working 20 hours a week and starting Phase 0. So I haven't gone as deep into some things as I would like. I view it as creating a debt to myself that I'll repay later. I could be googling more to gain a complex understanding of what I'm doing rather than hacking solutions together. But I've got everything working and I'm happy with that.

 I had a huge issue with the mv command, I didn't realise you had to type the whole filepath in order to move something so I just kept renaming the same file over and over. But I figured it out.

 I was pretty unclear on the workflow too. At first it was reading waffle, then there were a million pages on github, then waffle wasn't explaining how to get from one instruction to the next, then it turned out that there was an explanation on github, then back to waffle, and now when waffle doesn't explain things I wonder if there's a doc I'm not reading on github, the most un-navigable beast ever. But in saying that google has figured everything out for me.
