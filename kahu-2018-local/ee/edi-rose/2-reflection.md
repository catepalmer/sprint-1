What did I do well this week?
I am very proud of the work on my index page I made. I spent
today making it much more clean and tasteful codewise. I was able to use far more general rules and manipulate divs well.
What can I do to improve?
SOO muchh, I suck at using toggl, which is something I really need to work on. I finished a day late because I spent so much time working on my index page which will probably become redundant by next week, I wish I had, had some time to start on JAVA as I'm still super new to it.
