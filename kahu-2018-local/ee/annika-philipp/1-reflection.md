 Why is reflection important?

It helps me look critically at what I have done so far, what worked well and what didn't and enables me to be accountable to myself. 

 What did I do well this week?

 I've commited to a task (this course), worked on allocating time for study, work, exercise, free time and extra time and managed to stick to this plan. I learned a whole lot about html, css, command line, vs etc. that was new to me and wrote a first version of my blog page. I found a good balance between finding answers myself through 'struggle and play' as well as reaching out for help. Awesome.

 What could I have done to improve?

 Relax. I am learning to trust 'the system' that I will learn what I need to learn during the course, that I can approach tasks initially with an mvp focus and still finetune later on.
