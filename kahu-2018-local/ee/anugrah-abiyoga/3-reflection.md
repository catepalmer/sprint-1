# What did I do well this week?
I do think in terms of code I experimenting a lot of things as well as I spend more time this week I can finish my Sprint 3
#What could I have done to improve?
Perhaps, due to my perfectionistic, it slows me down. So I do think I could have finish sprint 3 one or two days ago.
