# What did I do well this week?
I do think in terms of codes, familiarity and time management I am starting to get used to it and become more effective.
# What could I have done to improve?
I should've spent more time every week for sprint 2 so that I could've finish it early. I hope before the end of October I could start sprint 4, so that I could catch up.
