Still crap at Toggl! Left it on again overnight...
I also only just did the Sprint 2 reflection due to issues merging with the cohort repo, so pretty similar to that really. 
Still enjoying it, the more I learn the better I feel. 
I guess an area I could improve on is trying to solve problems without looking at other people's code, but I also feel at this stage as long as I'm learning and not just blindly copying then it's OK - just be mindful of this and should be fine.
