##What did I do well this week?

This sprint I think I did well with the javascript tutorial as well as the free code camp, I maintained a consistent effort in a disciplined manner. Javascript isn't really my favourite, I'm much more into html and css, so this was a sprint where I really had to use my determination to work despite not really feeling that inspired.

##What could I have done to improve?

To improve I perhaps could have worded my tech blog a bit better, as it is right now I'm not sure if it's well phrased or understandable enough. I'd like to reword it sometime.
