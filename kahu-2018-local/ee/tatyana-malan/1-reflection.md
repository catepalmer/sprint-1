**Sprint 1 Reflection**


**Reflection is important** because it helps us to process what we've been doing; what worked, what didn't, the things we tried that we should remember, and the mistakes we made that we don't want to make again.

 I think **something I did well in Sprint 1** was communicating with the cohort in slackchat when I got stuck. It made progress much speedier, and broke the ice. I think teamwork will prove to be an invaluable tool during bootcamp and the rest of phase 0.

 I think **something I could have done to improve** would be to have sorted out my time management on toggl earlier, so that I didn't have to spend time later manually entering the time I spent on each activity.
