# What did I do well this week?
This week was full on reading, there was so much of material to read that it was the biggest challenge to complete. It feels like even with so much to read I was much more calmer than the very first week. Also I took plenty of time to read and re- read the concepts to understand. That was the best thing this week. I have tried to reflect on what I did every now and then and learned to fix any errors and giving it my best with my current knowledge.
 # What could I have done to improve?
 There is a always room for improvement I am still
 learning to time box what I do, but unfortunately
still struggling with time management. I will work on improving that.
