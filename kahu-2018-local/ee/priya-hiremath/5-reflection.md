# what did I do well this week?
This week is been very challenging in terms of learning Javascript. I had a panic attack as soon as I got back from my holiday as there was a huge backlog and felt like I have forgotten everything i have learned so far. Saying that I took a deep breath and decided to go slow with my assignments. That was pretty much the best thing I did "going slow and taking time to get my head around in action".

## what could I have done to improve?
Well, Not to think too much.... and get stressed.
