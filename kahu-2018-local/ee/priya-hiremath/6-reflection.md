# what did I do well this week?
This week Is been very hard for me. As working on Minesweeper  game is been a really a challenge. It's hard to understand lot of instructions as I have never played this game before. There is nothing much I did well this week .
It's  been a struggling week so far. I am able to get some help from my husband to get my Minesweeper assignments done and also to understand what needs to be done.
I guess the best thing this week I have done is decided and worked towards these assignments without giving up. I am keeping positive and  working hard that at some stage I will get sinked into this.

## what could I have done to improve?
I think to improve all I will have to do is more and more practice and finding a time to do that.
