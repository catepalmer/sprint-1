<b>What did I do well this week?</b>
<br>
I asked for help when I needed it and I tried my best.

<b>What could I have done to improve?</b>
<br>
Umm.. maybe mind exercises to get it to understand stuff better? I could have spend more time studying but I felt like I needed some time to myself a bit this week..
I could have gone back through some of the tutorials but I don't rreeaalllyyy think that would have helped my cause.
