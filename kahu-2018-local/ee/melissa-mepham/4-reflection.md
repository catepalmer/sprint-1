<b>What did I do well this week?</b>
I turned up with integrity and I gave all of my focus on learning JS. I was also patient with myself and didn't expect too much of myself.

<b>What could I have done to improve?</b>
I could have gone through the learning material again. I could have done more side reading, and tried to get better at getting the syntax correct..
