What did I do well this sprint?

Process over product mindset really helped me to stay focussed and within time limits this sprint. I also felt a boost in confidence knowing that the hard work of learning lots of new concepts (in parts through trial and error, play and asking for help) would set me on the right track for this sprint's tasks.

What could I have done to improve?

More time delving deeper into individual topics especially on the design front of my blog. But then there is more time later on, and I'm quite confident that a lot of this learning will just happen as time goes by.
