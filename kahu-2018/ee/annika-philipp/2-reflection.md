What did I do well this week?
Stuck to time frames, made sure I had regular breaks, dealt well with difficulties/frustrations. Asked for help/was able to help. 

What could I have done to improve?
Probably read a lot more or the supporting/extra documents, but the amount of extra time needed just wasn't there. At least a lot of these documents are bookmarked, so I'll be able to access them when I do have time or need them.
