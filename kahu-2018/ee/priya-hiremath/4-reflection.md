# What did I do well this week?
This week is so much challenging that I am not sure what really I did do well. Most important thing which possibly I have done well so far is staying positive and keeping faith that I will learn with the time. I think that is one thing which has kept me going. Apart from that I feel great as I have no backlog from last three sprints now. I have finished my blog work with new index.html page.

 # What could I have done to improve?
 As we all know there is always a room for improvement. I still have to improve in my time management skills. Sometimes I get carried away with perfecting something and loose track of time. I have also room to improve in not getting stressed too much. I am here to learn and it will take some time to sink in with everything I am doing at this stage.
