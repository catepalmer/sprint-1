# What did I do well this week?
This week was fun learning about responsive designs, wireframes etc. there is so much to read learn and add knowledge. I think this week I took my time to read well before I started with all my assignments. Which made me slightly confidant about what I am going to do in the assignments, even after that I still faced quite a few challenges.The best part was reflecting on my work helped me understand the concepts a lot more. I feel I am doing well with experimenting different tags and commands.
# What could I have done to improve
I could improve more if I can take some breaks in between reading my material to freshen my mind.
if I keep reading for long I feel slightly stressed. I need to focus on some small things like spelling mistakes etc. I think I will need to reflect more on what I have learned and how much I have understood and where I am at the present day.
