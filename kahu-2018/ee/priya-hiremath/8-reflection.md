# what did I do well this week?
I feel very sad to say that there is nothing great about this week. Seems like everything is getting really hard to understand. And It's very hard to figure out how to wire my brain to grasp javascript. I can do some JS with the help but it's hard when I am on my own. I get stuck for hours.
Well only thing I should say is that I am doing ok just because I am still hanging in there with the hope that Ii will be ok soon.
# what could I have done to improve
At this I really don't know, I am trying to read and re read .I guess more and more practice of fundamentals will help to improve. It feels like all the challenges are pretty advance for people who have just jumping into this computer world and have no idea about basic programming.
freecodecamp assignments are much harder than codecademy.
