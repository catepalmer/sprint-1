# What did I do well this week?
This week so far is been good for me. I feel I am one step above than where I was last week.
This week I have been working more focused than being feared about JS. that has helped  controlling my nerves and helped me to understand few concepts. Right now I am still at very beginning of JS but with some help I can understand what I need to do or where I am going wrong.  That's the best thing I feel has happened this week. I feel proud of what I am learning. And I believe I will get there someday.
# what could I have done better?
continue what I am doing now and do more of practice once I get done with my assignments.
