What did I do well this week?
  Hmm.. this is an interesting one, I don't really think there were any real tools or assignments apart from learning more about CSS and HTML, so I am not really sure how to answer that question.. I did a good job at taking in some more info on how to use grids in websites more efficiently, I also did well at listening when I didn't want to.. (I didn't really like the tutorials and it took some effort to take them seriously..)

What could I have done to improve?
  I could have spent some more time searching the web for websites that I like, but I feel like there is so much bad design, I would rather come by websites that I like organically.. uumm.. I could have learnt sooner to listen in terms of the tutorials but I got there in the end so I think its a win.. I could have been better with toggl.. I know I didn't record a little bit of my time, but I am not sure how much.. probably no more than an hour. I also feel like I should be spending more than the time I have been on these sprints, I remember hearing an average of 30hr per sprint so I feel like I am missing something, either that or maybe my design skills are helping and come booleans and ifs and elses I will take longer..
