    OOHH WOW! What did I DO this week!?! I solved problems using JavaScript all by myself with just myself and my little logic brain!

    You know, I am sure there was probably something I could have done better, maybe give myself better breaks, made sure I didn't do any coding on my bed (it just seems like the best place for blog posts!), maybe some more hand stretches, I am just really happy with my achievements that I don't want to dwell on this one much this sprint.
