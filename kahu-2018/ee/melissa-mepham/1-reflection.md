Why is reflection important?
Because it allows us to reflect on what we have done, what we could do better and why..

What did I do well this week?
I completed things.. I am quite happy at how I have picked up terminal. I thought I would really struggle but its been remarkably easy.

What could I have done to improve?
I need to work on my posture.. I have the tendancy to slouch a lot which is going to be bbbaaadddd
I could have spend some more time on making my blog look better, but I didn't really know how much time I could spend on it, and what was involved in the other parts of the sprint. I will probably go back and spend some more time on it later.
