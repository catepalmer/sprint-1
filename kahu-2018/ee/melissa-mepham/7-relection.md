<b>What did I do well this week?</b>
<br>
Far out, to be honest, I don't feel like I did very much well this sprint. well no, ok thats a lie. I completed 7.0 by myself! that was super tough, I got stuck a bunch, and learnt more about how to use developer tools in chrome! so thats a great thing!
<br>
I managed to learn more stuff, and feel a little more confident in JS

<b>What could I have done to improve?</b>
<br>
I had a pretty full on personal issue this sprint, and it took me three weeks to complete instead of the usual one.. I should have spent an hour min every day on code to keep my logical mind onto it, instead I spent nearly two weeks not doing any code so it was really tough to get back into it.. I need to spend a little bit of time every day learning, even if its watching some youtube tutorials..
