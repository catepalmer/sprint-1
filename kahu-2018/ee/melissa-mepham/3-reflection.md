What did I do well this week?
I think I tackled the website project pretty well, I have been really enthusiastic about this project so I do believe I gave it my all! I also made sure I gave myself a break when I was feeling really stuck and that helped find the solution.

What could I have done to improve?
I need to be working on my posture, and I could also be doing some touch type practice before I start.
I also need to be making sure I give myself proper breaks. I worked yesterday until my hand was sore and I have to make sure I look after my physical body more. in saying that I might head to yoga tonight.
