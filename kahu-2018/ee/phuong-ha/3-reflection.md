1. What did I do well this week?
The feeling is amazing when you can start planning layout by using HTML and write CSS rules and make the page rende the way you want for the first time after weeks learning from small examples. I am quite pleased with my website's appearance.

2. What could I have done to improve?
It would definitely be time management. Seems like I am far behind the pace for January bootcamp because I still struggle to arrange study time with work and care for my baby because I can not get in a fixed schedule. I think I should work quicker, being stricter on time-boxing and self discipline.

Another thing to be improved is that my code is not clean enough but I have no time to pay off this technical debt in this week. Next week, I will rearrange the rules, adding comments to separate rule set.

Last but not least, I made mistake when putting a table of content in every blog page, I thought it will be easier for reader to navigate but it turned out consume to much time re-adding link to all the page whenever I write a new blog post. I will fix it next week as well.
