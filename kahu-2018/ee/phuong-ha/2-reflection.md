1. What did I do well in the last sprint?
I think compare to my knowledge at the end of sprint-1, I have a big improvement on familiarizing myself with HTML tags, structures and CSS rules, properties. I had the basic idea looking at the source of the page and figure out what I need to know by searching HTML and CSS elements, their functions.
2. What do I need to improve?
I spent nearly two weeks on each of the first and second sprints because of distractions. I need more discipline to work 2 sprints per week to catch up and to be able to attend the bootcamp in January.
