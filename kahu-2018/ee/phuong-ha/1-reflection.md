1. Why is reflection important?
I think when we do relection, all of the thing we have covered will run through our mind again so firstly, it would help with memorizing, reinforcing knowledge. Secondly by identifying what we have done well and not so well help define our continued study plan so we will review and not omit knowledge in topics that we have not done so well.
2. What I have done well this week?
I am quite happy with my result this week as I am quite clear with all the concepts covered
3. What do I need to improve?
That would be CSS for sure because it was quite vague at the beginning. But I will do fine because after reading Shay Howe's book on HTML and CSS, I am able to grasp the foundation of CSS as well.
