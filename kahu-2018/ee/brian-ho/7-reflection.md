# What did I do well this week?

I played mentoring role during pair coding to help Belma to pick up knowledge to work on api-interaction task. I also helped Annika to resolve her problem related to git usage to help her move forward. Regarding the API Interaction project, I kind of like the final product. It shows how much I have improved in doing CSS and Design.

# What could I have done to improve?

I got stucked in writing cultural blog. It seems that I don't really know my core values and don't really know what I stand for. I need to take a hard look inside myself to search for answers.
