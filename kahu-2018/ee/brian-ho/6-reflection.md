# What did I do well this week?

I managed to finish coding assignment really fast, and also done the stretch goal on minesweeper by Tuesday. I also managed to answer a few questions to help my peer to move forward while they got stuck.

# What could I have done to improve?

I tend to procrastinate when it is time to do the writing. Writing should be the easiest part of all the sprint assignments, but I could felt my reluctance to write something. I wonder how I could overcome the reluctant feeling.

On the technical part, an idea to write a Sudoku game got me excited. But the excitement was a problem too. Writing a Sudoku game was not part of the sprint assignment, but in fact a big distraction. The higher priority was actually to finish the sprint assignment as quickly as possible, but my brain just couldn't let go of the thought on solving the coding algorithm for Sudoku game. It would be a problem to my team if I could not follow the priority in delivering my tasks.
