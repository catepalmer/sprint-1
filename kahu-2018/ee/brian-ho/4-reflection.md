# What did I do well this week?

I could finish the codecademy and freecodecamp assignments at fast pace. Due to my previous background, those are easy stuff for me. I really like the tutorial about arrow notation, forEach, map, and filter. Those are the advance convenience methods. I intend to use them more in future assignments that involve algorithm exercises, or just use them in future projects. Tt is time for me to move forward to use modern style of coding syntax.

This week, I have an opportunity to involve a little bit in a mentoring role when answering technical question from Melissa. I foresee that other may need guidance in technical stuff. But I will try to remind myself to just observe and learn. If you remember Star Trek series, they keep on saying 'Prime Directive'. I will follow the 'Prime Directive'. Sorry if you don't watch Star Trek, you won't know what I was trying to say.


# What could I have done to improve?

I was still not doing good in my productivity on doing this week's sprint. My target was to finish everything by Thursday, but it seems like I still couldn't make it. This is bad because I still don't have extra time to finish up my other technical course.

This week, I might have a violation of the 'Prime Directive'. I should just remain silence and wait for a few days before offering my advice. *wink*
