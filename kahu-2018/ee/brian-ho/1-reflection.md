# Why is reflection important?

It help us to give ourselves a time to pause and rethink what we have learnt. We could have scored some points and also make some mistakes along the way. When we reflect back, we could always find out how we could do better in the next time

# What did I do well this week?

I kept on reminding myself to commit my time into doing the assignment, even when I was beat down by flu virus and feeling tire all the time. I was also serious in going through the materials being offered and took note on what I learnt.

# What could I have done to improve?

I stumbled and procrastinate when in section related to time tracking. I guess I was really afraid to track my own time. I would like to make time tracking my long term habit. I was also slow down at the cultural reflection part when listening to Shereefâ€™s. It looks like I have difficulty to focus on listening when all the thing in the video is Shereef's face. This is also the part that I need to improve, be an active listener while looking at someone's eyes.
