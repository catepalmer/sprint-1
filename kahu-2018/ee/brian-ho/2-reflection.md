# What did I do well this week?

Techical stuff is not a problem. I could follow it without problem.

About the 'Search Inside Yourself' ebook, I used 'speak' function to turn the book to audio reading to help me speed up the reading. I'm usually the slow reader. Listening to audio reading while looking at the content of the book did help me learn the material at a faster rate.

# What could I have done to improve?

Sometimes, I forgot to start or stop Toggl timer. It means some of the time spent are not properly tracked, especially on the part related to reading ebook. 

About the slack interaction channel, I probably should have withhold my comment on technical question regarding using Chromebook (Let Jack do it instead). Without true first hand experience in Chromebook, my comment didn't really help much to the new student (my peer attending same phase), and end up unintentionally encouraging the student make the decision to go ahead to purchase Chromebook. I really felt bad when seeing the student asking question in help-desk channel because of struggling in setting up Chromebook to get ready for our course. I would be able to help the student to resolve the techincal issue in setting up the Chromebook, but unfornately, I'm not physically present at the EDA yet, so it is difficult to offer my assistant.

About the weekly check-in, I wrongly used the time to ask about assignment related questions instead of providing progress update. I will do better next time.
