What did I do well this week?
- I've gone through my reflection files and identifying areas that I want to address
- Making more time to work at Engineering Empathy materials
- I go through most of the Javascript exercises ok this week. I've heard good things about Eloquent Javascript so look forward to reading more of it.

Where do I need to improve?
- I need to go back and review JS lessons and note down areas I found difficult.
- Being ok with where I am at.
- Learning to let things go.
- Working with others. I tend to work by myself and not seek out others.
