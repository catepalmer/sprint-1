Why is reflection important?

It helps make sense of our decisions and identify what we could do better next time.

What did I do well this week?

Making sure I get assignments complete. Getting up to speed on Github commands.

What could I have done to improve?

I need to act on making more time to do my course work and review the supporting resources. I also need to make time to improve my typing speed. I did get stuck when I ran into problems uploading a repository to GitHub; I could have set a fixed amount of time to explore the issue and then reach out.
