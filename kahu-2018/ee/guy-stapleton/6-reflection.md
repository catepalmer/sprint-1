What did I do well this week?
- Perservered through 6.3. I got blocked for 2 hours and eventually figured out a solution
- I go through work at an ok pace.
- I understand the advantage of using a looping to check if a condition is true and then having some code to run after the loop if it is true.


Where can I improve?
- Explaining the concepts more clearly - I didn't really understand how looping through the objects would test each object and as soon as one object failed, it would end the test.
- Asking for help from others
- Tracking what I've tried and making sense why that didn't work
