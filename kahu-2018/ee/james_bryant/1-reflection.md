Reflection is important because it allows us to step back from the learning process and consider the extent to which we have understood the topic, and any opportunities to improve and gain more from future learning experiences.

I resisted the urge to treat it as a tick-boxing exercise, and where there were easy options to proceed perhaps without full understanding, I tried to dig a little deeper.

I could improve with more effective use of Toggl - I keep leaving it on when I walk away. I've never been very good at setting aside specific times for work, and more just working when the mood is right. Toggl and Pomodoro should help with that though by blocking distractions out and keeping me more disciplined.
