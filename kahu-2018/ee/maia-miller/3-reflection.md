What did I do well this week?

Creating my webpage was fun. I ran into obstacles that I didn't expect to, and I enjoyed coming up with different solutions to try and overcome those issues. I did a good job of problem solving - reading my code, reading code from other sites, looking up solutions and ways to code certain effects. I think I also did a good job of scaling back when I needed to - I had a specific look that I was going for, but when I realized that it was harder to execute than I initially thought, I went back to basics and worked on building a simpler yet similar site. This allowed me to practice other skills, as well as implement other elements that I wanted to because it gave me more time.

What could I have done to improve?

I still did spend a lot of time building the site, and when I asked for help on Slack, I was already exasperated and didn't want to work on it anymore, which meant that when I did receive help, I didn't go in right away and try to work on it. I think it would be wiser to seek help earlier so that my energy and attention isn't spent by the time I get help, meaning I can actually implement and interact with the assistance that I receive.
