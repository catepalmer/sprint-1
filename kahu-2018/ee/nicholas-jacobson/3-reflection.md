What did I do well this week?

I am getting better at focusing on process and not getting too distracted with the end product, this is a small incremntal
improvement, but better than nothing


 What could I have done to improve?


 I am still not applying the techniques I am learning all the time, it is something I am
 trying every day to improve.
