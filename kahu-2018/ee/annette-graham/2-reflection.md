1. What did I do well this week?
- I think I managed to focus a lot more during this sprint. I wasn't as nervous about getting things wrong and so was able to get fully stuck in. I feel I learnt a lot from the Udacity tutorials.

2. What could I have done to improve?
- I found it easy to spend too long on tweaking my CSS rather than getting on with the task at hand. I would get carried away on things like background colour and fonts.
