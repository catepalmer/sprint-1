week 2 reflection
This week was tough.  Had a lot of frustrating things get in the way this week
i.e. the flu, laptop giving up, buying a new laptop and setting that up.  But
despite all that still managed to get a little done and the enjoyment level of
the assignments and the challenges that they offer is still high.
Missed not going into the academy this week, as I found that a really good for
motivation and the people in their were fantastic and welcoming.
This week/next week need to improve time management and outside distractions.
