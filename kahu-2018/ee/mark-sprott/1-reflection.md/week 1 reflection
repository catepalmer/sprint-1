Why is reflection important - Reflection lets us look back at what we have done well and what we would like to improve.  Reflection offers us the chance to be better tomorrow then we were today and be thankful for the opportunities we received.
What did I do well this week - Managed to break down that wall of doubt by calming down and just taking it step by step
What could I have done to improve - Got into a study routine earlier
