## Sprint 3 Reflection


**What did I do well this sprint?**

I think this sprint I used my determination well, to keep on going with the redesign despite it taking a very long time with little progress for a few days. I was satisfied with the outcome of the blog, and I'm happy I stuck with it. I also
think I did well asking for help from my cohort, and used slackchat to help me progress with the tasks.

 **What could I have done to improve?**

 I could have, definitely, done a quick check on my browser zoom rather than spending a few days searching for "what was
 wrong with my code" when there was actually nothing wrong with it. Perhaps I could have also made a better wireframe with more realistic expectations the first time around, which would have saved me from making a second set of wireframes for the blog. Now that I've gone through this, I will know a few basic checks to solve code problems in the future, and also what sort of wireframes to design for skeleton CSS.
