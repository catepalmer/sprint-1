##What did I do well this sprint?

This sprint I think I managed my time quite effectively. I also implemented grid structure to my blog, which is looking miles better than it did in sprint 1. I think I got the technical debt done quite quickly, but I'm not sure because I have no point of reference. 

 ##What could I have done to improve?

 I think that I could have made sure my site was more responsive, I know right now it's not looking very good on mobile,
 but I think I'll definitely get the opportunity to work on that in the following sprints.
