What did I do well this week?
I really got the stuff about boxes and frameworks, I can't wait to have time to give it a go and create my own layouts on my own.

What could I have done to improve?
I think trying to finish this week's work in a week was overly ambitious. I've achieved it but now I have only 45 mins to rest before starting next week's work in my real job. I had to spend a lot of time with friends and family in London this week and then fly from London to Spain yesterday. I probably should have let this week's work spill over into next week, which they said might happen. I'm just very deadline oriented.
