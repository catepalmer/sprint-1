What did I do well this week
Understanding the content and getting it all done in one day. I really enjoyed what we learned this week, I feel like I'm really getting it.

What could I have done to improve
I got sunstroke on Monday so my brain feels ratty. I've been trying to rest it. But I have work and coding to do. I've achieved it all which is great but I think my brain needs more rest than what I'm allowing it. So I've slept through most of the week and rushed through a lot of things at the end of this sprint in order to stay up to speed with coding. So I could've spent more time on fine tuning a lot of areas. But the instructions were function not form.
