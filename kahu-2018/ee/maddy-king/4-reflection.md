What did I do well this week?
Letting myself have 2 weeks for this challenging sprint instead of killing myself to do it all in one.


What could I have done to improve?
This sprint took me two weeks. I should have given myself more time but this is the first sprint it was actually hard and it took me by surprise. I could have been kinder to myself about how challenging I found it. I really started questioning whether I had the brain to do this programme.
