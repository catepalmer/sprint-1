What did i do well this week?
I hit a few barriers this week but asked for help and got sorted so i think that was good instead of just feeling overwhelmed.  

What could i have improved on?
I got quite distracted when i had to read the emtional intelligence chapter and that made me start procrastinating so i definitley need to find some ways of focusing on the things that i find harder.
