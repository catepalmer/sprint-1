      <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
      <p>If you think of a web page as being like a person’s body, HTML would be the skeleton, CSS would provide the surface features like skin and hair, and the DOM would be the person’s genetic material (giving instructions for how everything fits together).</p>
      <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
      <p>Boxifying design basically just means dividing a webpage into smaller and smaller boxes so that different features can be applied separately to them (e.g. CSS can be written that applies to the whole body of the page, or to smaller boxes within it).</p>
      <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
      <p>The box model is a way of specifying the size, shape, etc of various features of different ‘boxes’ on the page - the content within them, the padding around the content that’s still within the box's borders, the borders themselves, and the margins around these borders that stop other boxes from sitting right next to the first box’s borders.</p>
