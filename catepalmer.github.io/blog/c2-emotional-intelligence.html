      <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      <p>Emotional intelligence consists of a set of skills that can be learned - it’s not an innate, fixed attribute of a person. It’s also inextricably linked to things like happiness, resilience, and optimism. The key skills it consists of include self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.</p>
      <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>I found it easy and very enjoyable - I think reading the chapter in some way mentally prepared me to be able to access a state of mindfulness quite effortlessly. I was just very disappointed when my alarm went off to let me know the two minutes was up!</p>
