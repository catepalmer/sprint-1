      <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
      <p>I was kind of already aware of this from reading about EDA and listening to others talk about the course, but my take on the experience from a distance was always, ‘Wow, that sounds really exciting and cutting-edge and much more geared towards actually teaching people the skills they’ll need to find work and providing an environment that encourages students to be curious and self-motivated and in the driver’s seat when it comes to their own learning than any kind of university course I’ve ever heard of.’ I also really responded to Shereef’s 'kitchen vs. restaurant' metaphor and thought it probably distilled the difference between a course like EDA and more traditional formal education really well - I was encouraged to hear that distinction outlined so clearly, because I’m at a stage where I’ve done way too much university study and I just have no patience left for that kind of learning environment. EDA sounds tough and like it requires a huge amount of you, but in a way that’s motivating rather than mind-numbing.</p>
      <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>My impressions are that the EDA bootcamp involves a lot of very hard work, but that it can be a very rewarding and worthwhile course for those who choose to make it that and really try to engage with the material and the process. It doesn’t seem like a course for people who want to just sit back and have their education fed to them - it seems much more geared towards people who see themselves as having ultimate control over what they learn and how they go about learning it.</p>
      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>I kind of see the culture EDA promotes as a challenge to students to show up and really engage, both with the material and with the instructors and each other - and I’d really like to take that challenge on and do my best to meet it. I did a Master’s degree a few years ago where I really didn’t understand that something similar to that way of engaging was required of me, and I struggled a lot throughout that programme because I was constantly frustrated that things weren’t handed to me on a platter and I couldn’t just skulk in the shadows and not engage with anyone. With EDA I want to do things very differently from that, and I also want to remain aware the whole way through that the aim isn’t just to graduate with some kind of piece of paper acknowledging that I finished the course, but to make an effort to get as much out of it as I can, since I’m the one who will have to go forward afterwards with whatever I’ve learned along the way.</p>
      <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>Not really; I’d talked to enough people that were familiar with EDA to have got quite a clear sense of what the course was like, and my decision to sign up was very much about all the ways in which it stands out from other kinds of formal education and the culture it promotes. I just feel pleased that it’s confirming all my expectations so far.</p>
