      <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
      <p>I’ve previously experimented a bit with timeboxing (primarily using a Pomodoro timer) and have found that it did increase my level of focus, although I haven’t used it recently (other than timeboxing an hour to read the time and habit management resources). I found that a lot of the material in the ‘Seven Counterintuitive Ways to be Insanely Productive’ article really resonated with me - I used to be quite rigid in how I attempted to structure my time when I was working on something, and this would usually backfire in that I would inevitably fall off the wagon when I couldn’t live up to the standards I was trying to impose on myself from the outside - so I have been more mindful recently of making room for breaks and treating things that increase my overall wellbeing as important in and of themselves (like meditation, although I tend more to use guided meditation and journalling). I have also previously tried using organisation systems like GTD, but with limited success.</p>
      <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
      <p>The line 'People don’t procrastinate because they’re lazy. People procrastinate as a self-defense mechanism against doing stuff they despise or doing things too mechanically’ from ‘Seven Counterintuitive Ways to be Insanely Productive’ rang really true for me. I also found the material on habit formation very interesting - all the advice on starting small and using existing habits to trigger new habits seemed to make a lot of sense, and the idea of using extrinsic motivation to get a new habit started but recognising that for it to continue, there will need to be intrinsic motivation associated with the benefits accruing from it in order for it to continue into the long term seemed accurate as well. I had also previously encountered material on Carol Dweck’s ‘fixed’ vs. ‘growth’ mindsets, but I did find it interesting to have it explicitly noted that someone can have a fixed mindset in some areas of their life and a growth mindset in others - that also rang very true.</p>
      <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
      <p>Timeboxing an hour to read through the material worked surprisingly well for me, so I’m interested in experimenting more with timeboxing techniques - which could be particularly helpful for me as I have perfectionistic tendencies and sometimes spend longer on tasks than I know I probably should.</p>
      <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      <p>I’m very keen to start trying to form some new habits in terms of structuring my workday - I think the idea of using exisiting habits to trigger new ones, and starting small, could be quite helpful for me. I also like the idea of deliberately incorporating things like meditation into my day (which seems to consciously acknowledge the fact that humans aren’t robots, and overall wellbeing is important and activities that promote this need to be deliberately worked in (and can actually have an overall positive effect on productivity anyway)).</p>
