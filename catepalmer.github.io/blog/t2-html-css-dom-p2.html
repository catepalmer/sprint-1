      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>Grid-based design involves building the page layout of a website on an underlying framework of columns (usually 12 in total) and rows so that the page can be divided easily into sections and the content laid out in a way that’s visually appealing and easy to follow.</p>
      <h3>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>A responsive webpage displays differently depending on the size of the screen it’s viewed on, and is built with a variety of screen types (and what would be easiest and most visually appealing to view on each of them) in mind - e.g. laptops, tablets, phones, and desktops.</p>
      <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>Semantic structure is the structure determined by the different elements and their functions and order of prominence in an HTML file - e.g. h1, h2, h3, etc. Elements are named according to their function, which makes the HTML make more semantic sense.</p>
